descr=_"A map for solo challenge. You start from the middle, and you gradually fight your way outside. At every ring you will find a new enemy, each stronger than the previous one. Kill them fast: every ore your opponent digs from the mines is one less ore that you will have to fight the next ring. But you will also have to fight with your stretching logistics. Port spaces are under the enemy headquarters."
