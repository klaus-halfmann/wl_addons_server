author="King of nowhere"
descr=_"The stories say that once our tribe lived in the fertile land to the west, where plants and crops grow and one does not need to dig deeply to  find water. But the easy life made us weak and lazy. One day the invaders came from the sea, and they conquered and pillaged, and they cast us out of our land. The few survivors were forced to escape in the desert, where they have struggled to survive ever since. But the stories speak of hope. They tell of a wise leader that will come, one that will be able to tame the desert and build a mighty civilization over it. A leader that will somehow find in this barren place the resources to train a powerful army, and will lead it across the high passes into the fertile land that we were forced to flee generations ago, slaughter the invaders, who have grown soft in their comfort like we did before them, and claim that land once again as ours!   Has that leader finally arrived? "
hint=_"- This is a solo challenge map, with the blue player strongly disadvantaged.  - There is no coal in the desert; you have to sustain charcoal burners with the scant fertile land you have. That's the challenge.  - Follow the water! Patches of fertile land indicate underground streams; follow them to find the oasis."
