descr=_"can you survive without resources surrounded by six hostile forces? can you outproduce seven opponents when you have every possible disadvantage?  Intended to give a big challenge to a human (blue) playing 1v7 against AI. It makes no sense otherwise.     HINTS: follow the dry riverbed to the sea. make a port, settle the islands. you have no coal, so you'll need charcoal burners. the enemies have more resources than you, so you should be fast in killing them. standing stones in the starting valley indicate resources. Play this map only if you are really good, or suicidal."
